This is a readme about the project I am working on.
If this was the Sports Comics project, this is the place where'd I'd start listing out all the
functionality I will be adding to the site

Here is a further change to this file in order to understand the process


As part of the merging section of the git course, I'm making this change to the readme file

this is also done as part of the merge section. It's on a different line so I shouldn't get a conflict

this version of readme.txt doesn't have the changes I committed on the master branch
I wonder what this will do after I commit
